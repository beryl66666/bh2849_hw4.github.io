## Hello üíê

Good Morning, and in case I don't see you, good afternoon, good evening, and good night!

This is Binyue, an entry level data scientist who is learning R in the Dara Science I. 

Besides, I am also taking Biostatistical Methods, Probability, and Principle of Epidemiology this semester. 

In my free time, I like hiking, travelling and dancing. 

Please feel free to explore my website, and you can contact me through the email directly!
